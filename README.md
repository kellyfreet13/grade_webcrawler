The grade webcrawler uses python and selenium to navigate through the
CSLUB student portal and scrape information regarding the user's grades.

This information is then plotted nicely and displayed to the user with 
useful information such as what he or she would need to go up or down
a grade level. (To be implemented shortly once there is some grade 
data to work with, since it is the beginning of the semester)
